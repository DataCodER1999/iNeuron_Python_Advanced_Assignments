    "\n",
    "Efficiency: The float class is implemented using native floating-point arithmetic, which is typically more efficient in terms of memory usage and computational speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard arithmetic: float follows the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic, which is widely supported by hardware and software implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Drawbacks of float:\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited precision: Due to the nature of binary representation, float numbers have limited precision, leading to potential rounding errors and inaccuracies, especially in decimal calculations involving recurring fractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lack of exact decimal representation: Certain decimal values, such as 0.1, cannot be represented exactly as float due to the binary representation limitations. This can lead to unexpected behavior in some calculations"
