    "The concept of an abstract superclass in object-oriented programming refers to a class that is designed to be inherited by other classes, but cannot be instantiated on its own. It serves as a blueprint or template for its subclasses, providing a common interface, attributes, and/or methods that the subclasses must implement or override.\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract superclass typically contains abstract methods, which are methods that are declared but have no implementation in the superclass. The responsibility of implementing these methods lies with the subclasses. By defining abstract methods in the abstract superclass, it enforces a contract that any class inheriting from it must provide an implementation for those methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of an abstract superclass is to define a common set of behaviors, characteristics, or interfaces that its subclasses should adhere to. It provides a way to enforce a consistent structure and behavior among related classes, while allowing each subclass to implement its own specific functionality."
