    "Error Reporting and Logging: Exception processing allows for the detection and reporting of errors and exceptions that occur during program execution. By catching and handling exceptions, you can provide meaningful error messages or logs that assist in identifying and diagnosing issues. This helps in debugging and improving the overall reliability and maintainability of the software.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graceful Program Termination: Exceptions can be used to handle fatal errors or exceptional conditions that cannot be recovered from. Instead of abruptly terminating the program, exception processing enables you to gracefully exit the program while performing necessary cleanup operations. For example, you can release resources, close open files, or perform any other necessary finalization steps before terminating the program.\n",

    "User Input Validation: Exception processing is commonly used to validate user input and handle input-related errors. When accepting user input, various issues can arise, such as incorrect data types, out-of-range values, or invalid formats. By using exception handling, you can catch and handle these input-related exceptions, provide appropriate feedback to the user, and prompt for correct input."
