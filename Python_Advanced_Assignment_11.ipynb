    "Class decorators and metaclasses are two different mechanisms in Python for handling classes, but they can overlap in functionality to some extent. Both class decorators and metaclasses allow you to modify the behavior and structure of classes. However, they operate at different stages of class creation and offer different levels of customization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Class decorators are functions or callable objects that are applied to a class after its creation but before it is assigned to a name. They modify the class directly by adding or modifying attributes, methods, or metadata. Class decorators are applied using the @decorator syntax, where decorator is the decorator function or object.\n",

Metaclasses operate at a lower level than class decorators and can provide more fine-grained control over the class creation process.\n",

    "The overlap between class decorators and metaclasses lies in their ability to modify class behavior. Both can add or modify methods, attributes, or metadata of a class. However, there are some distinctions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Stage of application: Class decorators are applied after the class creation, while metaclasses are involved in the creation process itself. This means that class decorators can only modify the class after it has been defined, whereas metaclasses can intercept and modify the class during its creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scope of modification: Class decorators typically operate on a single class and can modify it directly. Metaclasses, on the other hand, can affect multiple classes. By defining a metaclass for a base class, you can influence the behavior of all its subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customization level: Metaclasses provide a higher level of customization as they can control various aspects of class creation, such as attribute inheritance, method resolution, instance creation, and more. Class decorators, while powerful, offer a more limited scope of customization."
