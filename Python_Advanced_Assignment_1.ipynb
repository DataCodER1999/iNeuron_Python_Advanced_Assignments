    "Here are some key purposes of Python's OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity: OOP allows you to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable components. You can define classes to represent objects with specific characteristics and behaviors, promoting code organization and reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: OOP enables encapsulation, which means bundling data and methods together within a class. This allows you to hide the internal implementation details of an object and expose only the necessary interfaces, enhancing code maintainability and reducing dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: OOP supports abstraction by allowing you to define abstract classes and interfaces. Abstract classes provide a blueprint for subclasses and define common attributes and methods, while interfaces specify a set of methods that classes must implement. Abstraction helps in creating generalized and reusable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOP that allows you to create new classes based on existing ones. The new class inherits the attributes and methods of the base class (parent class), which promotes code reuse and supports the \"is-a\" relationship. In Python, multiple inheritance is supported, meaning a class can inherit from multiple parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method call. It allows you to write code that can work with objects of different types, as long as they implement the required interface or have a common base class. Polymorphism promotes flexibility and extensibility."

    "The MRO order is important because it ensures that attribute lookup follows a consistent and predictable path. The search for an attribute moves from the current instance to its class, then to its parent class, and so on, following the linearized order of the inheritance hierarchy."

It defines the attributes and methods that instances of the class will possess. An instance object, on the other hand, is created when you instantiate the class using the class name followed by parentheses, like a function call. Each instance is a unique object with its own set of attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage: The class object is primarily used to define the structure and behavior of the class. It holds the class-level attributes and methods that are shared among all instances. Instance objects, on the other hand, are used to represent individual objects created from the class. They hold the instance-specific data and can access both the class-level attributes and methods as well as their own instance-specific attributes and methods.\n",

    "\n",
    "Instance Binding: By convention, the first argument of a method is named self, although you can use any valid variable name. When a method is called on an instance object, the self parameter is automatically bound to that instance. It allows the method to access and manipulate the instance's attributes and call other instance methods.\n",

    "Implicit Passing: When you call an instance method, you don't need to explicitly pass an argument for self. Python takes care of passing the instance object as the first argument automatically. This automatic passing of the instance object ensures that the method has access to the instance's data and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance-Specific Access: The self parameter allows instance methods to access and modify the instance's attributes. Inside the method, you can use self.attribute_name to refer to the instance's attribute. This enables the method to operate on the specific instance's data, providing instance-specific behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method Invocation: The special self parameter is essential for invoking other methods on the instance. By using self.method_name(), you can call other instance methods from within the class. This enables method chaining and allows one method to leverage the functionality of other methods defined in the same class."
