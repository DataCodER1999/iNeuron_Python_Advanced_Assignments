    "\n",
    "A NumPy array is a multidimensional grid of values, all of the same data type, and it is optimized for numerical operations. It provides efficient storage and vectorized operations on arrays of homogeneous data types. NumPy arrays are commonly used for numerical computations and mathematical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a Pandas DataFrame is a two-dimensional tabular data structure that can contain columns of different data types. It is built on top of NumPy and provides additional functionality specifically designed for data manipulation and analysis. DataFrames have labeled axes (rows and columns) and support features like indexing, slicing, filtering, grouping, merging, and more. They are widely used for data analysis, data cleaning, and data preprocessing tasks."
