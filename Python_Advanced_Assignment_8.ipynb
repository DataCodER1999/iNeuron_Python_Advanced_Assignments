    "Lack of Type Safety: String-based exceptions do not provide type safety because they are just plain strings. It becomes challenging to distinguish between different types of exceptions based on their string names. This lack of type safety can lead to errors and make code harder to debug and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduced Expressiveness: String-based exceptions are limited in their expressiveness. They do not offer any additional attributes or methods that can provide useful information about the exception. With class-based exceptions, you can define custom attributes and methods to convey specific details and behaviors related to the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited Exception Handling: String-based exceptions do not allow for fine-grained exception handling. Since all string-based exceptions are treated as instances of the same generic Exception class, it becomes difficult to handle different exceptions separately and take appropriate actions based on the specific exception type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Readability and Maintainability: Using string-based exceptions can make code less readable and maintainable. Developers may have to rely on string comparisons or other workarounds to differentiate between exceptions, which can lead to complex and error-prone code."
