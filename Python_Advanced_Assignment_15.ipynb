By using the / syntax, you can specify that certain parameters must be passed positionally and cannot be passed as keyword arguments. This helps improve API consistency and reduces confusion when calling functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "f-strings Support \"=\" for Debugging: Python 3.8 introduced the ability to use the = sign within f-strings for better debugging. By using f\"{expression=}\", you can include the value and the expression being evaluated in the resulting string, aiding in debugging and understanding the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax Warning for \"async\" and \"await\" outside Functions: Python 3.8 introduced a syntax warning when using the async and await keywords outside of function definitions. This helps catch potential mistakes and encourages correct usage of asynchronous programming constructs.\n",
    "\n",
    "New Features in the typing Module: Python 3.8 introduced enhancements to the typing module, which provides support for type hints and annotations. Some new features include the TypedDict class for creating dictionaries with specific key-value types, Literal for defining literal types, and Protocol for structural subtyping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance Improvements: Python 3.8 included several performance improvements, such as faster parsing, optimized dictionary and set operations, and faster sorting using the sorted() function."
