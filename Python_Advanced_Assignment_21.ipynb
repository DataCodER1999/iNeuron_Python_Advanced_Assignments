    "A probability distribution is a mathematical function that describes the likelihood of different outcomes or events occurring in a specific set of circumstances. It provides a systematic way to assign probabilities to various possible outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of probability theory and statistics, a probability distribution characterizes the behavior of a random variable. A random variable represents a quantity whose outcome is uncertain or subject to chance. The probability distribution specifies the probabilities associated with different values or ranges of values that the random variable can take.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the values of a random variable are inherently unpredictable on an individual basis, the probability distribution allows us to understand the overall pattern of possible outcomes and their associated probabilities. It provides information about the likelihood of different outcomes occurring and their relative likelihoods. By analyzing and understanding the probability distribution, we can make predictions and draw conclusions about the behavior of random events or variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that while individual outcomes may be unpredictable, the collective behavior of random variables follows certain statistical patterns as described by their probability distributions. These patterns emerge through the aggregation of numerous random events or occurrences, allowing for predictions and inferences to be made at a probabilistic level."

Each random number generated from a true random source is independent of previous and future numbers.\n",

However, given the same seed, a PRNG will always produce the same sequence of numbers."
